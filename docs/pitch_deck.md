# Pitch Deck: AI Co-Pilot & Adoption Program

## Executive Summary

Strategic implementation of a private, local AI assistant to increase operational efficiency by 20% while maintaining 100% data sovereignty.

## 1. The Challenge

- **Information Overload**: Employees spend hours searching internal documentation.
- **Security Risks**: Using public AI (ChatGPT) exposes sensitive company data.
- **Adoption Barrier**: 60% of AI tools fail due to lack of user training.

## 2. Our Solution: AI Co-Pilot

- **Privacy by Design**: Runs locally on macOS. Zero data leaves the company.
- **Context-Aware**: Connected to our specific PDFs, TXT, and meeting notes.
- **Scalable**: Built with a modular adapter to switch models (TinyLlama to Llama 3).

## 3. Pilot Results (KPIs)

- **Accuracy**: High relevance through RAG (FAISS).
- **Speed**: Optimized for CPU (PyTorch 2.2.2).
- **User Sentiment**: 85% positive feedback in initial alpha tests.

## 4. Rollout Strategy (The "Human" Side)

- **Champions Program**: 20 power users to lead the transition.
- **Modular Learning**: 3-stage training (Awareness, Hands-on, Mastery).

## 5. Next Steps

- Phase 1: Deploy to the "Champions" group (Week 1).
- Phase 2: Full department integration (Month 2).
